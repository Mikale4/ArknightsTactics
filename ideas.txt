Mechanical & Balance (combat systems)

Element auras: battlefield “weather” (e.g., Sandstorm = +20% glancing, Acid Rain = DoTs tick harder).

Damage sharing & link: two allies split incoming damage; targetable link break.

Taunt vs Provoke split: Taunt = target-locked; Provoke = S1-only; adds counterplay depth.

Stacking statuses: e.g., “Frostbite” stacks → converts to STUN at 3 stacks.

Shield types: absorb-only (current), reflect, and “guard” shields (reduce DEF Break duration).

Purify levels: Cleanse 1/2/All vs. “Dispel” (removes buffs first) vs. “Strip %”.

Heal-overflow → shield: friendly overheal converts to temporary shield (capped).

Focused resist: unit can “brace” to trade ATB for +RES and +DEF for one turn.

Fun Modes & Replayability

Draft mode (4× pick/ban): you/AI alternate picks with a ban phase; draft log at start.

Time trials: win in ≤ X turns; rerun with seed; board shows “best” time and team.

Endless tower: ascending waves with mutators every 5 floors.

Scenario puzzles: win in 1–2 turns with fixed hands; daily rotating micro-challenges.

Mirror match: enemies clone your leader/runes (forces different tactics).

Boss rush: back-to-back scripted bosses with limited heals between fights.

Weekly mutators: global rule-of-the-week (e.g., Violent doesn’t proc; Despair chance +10%).

“Hardcore” toggle: deaths persist for 1 battle; resurrect at camp (see Campaign).

Lore & Campaign (lightweight narrative)

Faction arcs: Rhine Lab, Ursus, Victorian threads; unlock nodes via wins.

Dialogue snippets: 1–2 lines pre/post battle; light choice branches (“Help/Ignore”).

Boss personalities: two-skill variants, witty battle barks, combat phases.

Node modifiers: per-story node aura (e.g., “Medicine Ban” = heals reduced 50%).

Camp screen: revive KO’d units, craft 1 buff (once per chapter).

Relic-lite: choose 1 of 3 team passives after key fights (reset per run).

Cut-in vignettes: small portrait + line when S3 used or leader dies.

Codex: unlock short bios/tooltips as you meet units or debuffs.

Options & UX / QoL

In-battle hotkeys: 1/2/3 = skills; A/D cycle targets; Space confirm; Esc cancel.

Log presets: remember Mini/Simple/Detailed per session; icon on board when “Close”.

Buff/Debuff glossary: hover chip → tiny tooltip (stacking rules, dispel level).

Skill queue preview: faint outline shows who you’ll hit before you click.

Compact board view: smaller cards, bigger portraits; toggle in battle.

Post-battle summary: damage dealt/received, healing, top debuff applier.

Replay seed copy button (seed only) for reproducibility (no save/copy share storage).

Accessibility: colorblind palette; font scale slider; reduce motion toggle.

New Features (builders & editors)

Preset manager: rename, duplicate, reorder your 10 squad slots.

Set builder: pick two runes → live preview vs. current; one-click apply to all selected units.

Batch rune apply: apply advisor pick to multiple units by Role/Class filter.

Portrait mapping UI: paste key → URL, store in localStorage; preview in roster.

Remote packs (optional): load UnitsDB/runes from a hosted JSON (live-update without rebuilding).

Sparring range: select any enemy preset (boss script, aura) and fight it repeatedly.

Targeting profiles: save “kill order” and “cleanse first” preferences per preset.

AI & Logging

AI styles deepening:

Aggressive: prefer Brand+DEF Break chains; value kill thresholds.

Safe: value cleanse > S3 nuke; avoid COUNTER+IMMUNITY.

Balanced: current behavior with slight weight to debuffed/low HP.

Explain AI (Detailed log): “Ifrit picked Lee (DEF BREAK + lowest turns-to-kill)”.

Heal logic weights: “heal lowest HP% unless target has Heal Block”.

Skill estimator toggles: assume Crit ON/OFF; ignore Brand; display both.

Progression & Economy (optional, simple & off by default)

Light mastery: play earns tokens to boost one stat by tiny amounts (session only).

Rune crafting (sandbox): randomize two-set outcomes with caps; no inventory grind.

Milestone chests: complete 5 challenges → cosmetic badge in UI.

Polishing the systems you already added

Rune Advisor: let me add a “Why” line (“Sniper → Crit scaling; Blade pairs with Fatal/Rage”).

Skill Impact Preview: show both Non-Crit and Crit % explicitly (“Est: 12–31%”), and recompute when you change the default target in the picker.

Revive clarity: when Sanctuary revives → HP% line + brief sparkle over the revived card; ensure HP% label clamps to ≥1% when alive.
